# A Collection of fMRI Tools

This site provides a landing page to summarize resources within the ME-ICA organization.

!!! note
    ME-ICA was originally created specifically for the ``tedana`` library,
    which uses independent components analysis (ICA) on multi-echo (ME) fMRI
    data. As part of development, we built tools that work with ``tedana``
    but may also have stand-alone uses for processing and visualizing fMRI
    data that is not multi-echo. While the "ME-ICA" may not accurately
    describe all these tools, we have chosen to keep it for now because we're
    used to it.

## tedana

[tedana][] TE Dependant ANAlysis. Calculates echo dependance of each ICA component and denoises data by removing components that are unlikely to contain BOLD signal.

## rica

[rica][] Reports for ICA. An app to visualize ICA components and perform manual classification in an interactive way. This could work on any component maps of
fMRI data. It currently expects some files that are outputted by ``tedana``
but similar files could be generated by other programs or addition input
options could be added to ``rica``

## mapca

[mapca][] Moving Average Principal Components Analysis. This started as a
Python port of the dimensionality reduction technique described in
[Li et al 2007][MAPCAref] and used in [GIFT][].

## ddmra

[ddmra][] is a Python package for performing distance-dependent motion-related
artifact analyses. This is modeled after the analyses performed in
[Power et al 2018][Powerref]

## me-ica

[meica][] The package that started it all. This is a clone of the multi-echo denoising code by Prantik Kundu that ``tedana`` is based on. It is no longer maintained, and only runs on Python 2.7. It may be useful as a reference to to replicate past work, but we
recommend people use ``tedana`` instead of this.

# Works in progress

We welcome contributors, but there are not ready for general use.

## Multi-Echo (fMRI) Data Analysis Book

[multi-echo-data-analysis][] An early-stage effort to create a Jupyter-based
book to explain multi-echo fMRI analysis and ``tedana``. Comments, ideas,
and contributions are very welcome.

## aroma

[aroma][] is a fork of [ICA-AROMA][]
which we have been working to make work purely with Python, in a
BIDS-compatible manner. AROMA is similar to ``tedana`` in that it uses
features of ICA components to classify some as noise to remove them. Tedana's
features are primarily based on how signals change across echoes. AROMA's
features are based on how much of a component's highly weighted voxels are
near brain or ventricle edges and whether component time series are too high
frequency to be BOLD. There are complementary approaches that may work well
together.

## godec

[godec][] is a Python package for [Go Decomposition][godec-ref], specifically built to work with fMRI data.

## Scientific Conferences

We have documented the progress of tedana at the Organization
For Human Brain Mapping annual meetings. For several years,
we have shared the tedana poster, an interactive demonstration of the results
and compiled other multi-echo posters and presentations at the conference.
Each year includes an interactive demonstration of how tedana's output looked
at that time.
